1,1,1,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth experienced a significant decline. It dropped by 0.7 years to 72.5 years in 2020, returning to the level of 2016, and further decreased by 1.1 years to 71.4 years in 2021, reverting to the level of 2012. This marked a reversal of nearly a decade of progress in just two years.",1.4
2,1,2,"The Region of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region were hit hardest by the pandemic, with life expectancy in both regions dropping by 3.0 years and healthy life expectancy (HALE) by 2.5 years between 2019 and 2021. In contrast, the Western Pacific Region was the least affected during the first two years of the pandemic, experiencing minimal losses in life expectancy and HALE (less than 0.1 years and 0.2 years, respectively) (Figure 1.2).",1.2
3,1,3,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the global disease burden shifted significantly back towards communicable diseases. The share of deaths due to communicable diseases increased from 18.2% in 2019 to 23.0% in 2020 and further to 28.1% in 2021, reversing the previous trend of declining communicable disease mortality. Simultaneously, the share of noncommunicable disease (NCD) deaths decreased from 73.9% in 2019 to 69.9% in 2020 and 65.3% in 2021, as shown in Figure 1.4.",1.4
4,2,1,"In 2021, the top causes of death globally included ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and COVID-19, with COVID-19 emerging as the second leading cause, claiming 8.8 million lives globally. Other significant causes were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, and diabetes mellitus, as shown in Figure 1.7.",1.7
5,2,2,"Yes, COVID-19 ranked differently across regions in 2021. It was the leading cause of death in the Region of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region, and the second leading cause in the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions. In contrast, it ranked sixth in the African Region and was not among the top 10 in the Western Pacific Region, where it moved from 50th in 2020 to 19th in 2021, as shown in Figure 1.8.",1.8
6,2,3,"During the period from 2000 to 2020, there was a marked reduction in maternal mortality, with the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) dropping from 339 to 223 deaths per 100,000 live births. However, progress has stagnated since 2015. For child mortality, the global under-five mortality rate (U5MR) declined by 51% from 76 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 37 in 2022, although progress slowed in the first half of the SDG era compared to the MDG era, as noted in [3] and [7].",1.1
7,3,1,"The world has made significant progress in reducing new HIV infections, with a 54% reduction from 2.8 million in 2000 to 1.3 million in 2022, and a 27% reduction from 2015. The global HIV incidence rate decreased by 32% from 2015 to 2022. However, despite these improvements, the world is still far from reaching the 2025 and 2030 targets of reducing new infections to 370,000 and 335,000, respectively, as outlined in global initiatives (Context [1] and [2]).",2.12
8,3,2,"For tuberculosis (TB), the global incidence rate was 133 per 100,000 population in 2022, showing a decline from 180 in 2000. However, the reduction from 2015 to 2022 was only 8.7%, falling short of the WHO End TB strategy's target of a 50% reduction by 2025 (Context [2]). Regarding malaria, there were an estimated 249 million cases in 2022, with the incidence rate slightly decreasing to 58.4 per 1,000 population at risk, but still far from the Global Technical Strategy targets (Context [5]).",2.2
9,3,3,"Yes, there are notable success stories in disease elimination. Egypt has achieved ""gold tier"" status on the path to eliminating hepatitis C, thanks to a comprehensive public health campaign that included widespread testing and treatment (Box 2.2). Additionally, Bangladesh has successfully eliminated visceral leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis as public health problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted interventions and collaborations (Box 2.3).",2.2
10,4,1,"Globally, tobacco use has been declining, with a 21% relative reduction in prevalence from 2010 to 2022, and is projected to achieve a 25% reduction by 2025, although this falls short of the 30% target (Context [5]). Alcohol consumption, measured as total alcohol per capita (APC), has also seen a decline, with a 4.5% reduction from 2010 to 2019, but remains higher than the 2000 level (Context [1]). Despite these reductions, the European Region continues to have the highest APC, while the South-East Asia Region is the only one where APC has continuously increased (Context [1]).",2.6
11,4,2,"Yes, access to clean water and sanitation has improved globally. Between 2015 and 2022, the global coverage of safely managed drinking water increased from 69% to 73%, and safely managed sanitation rose from 49% to 57% (Context [3]). However, to achieve universal access by 2030, the rate of progress needs to increase significantly, with a sixfold increase required for water and a fivefold increase for sanitation (Context [3]).",2.9
12,4,3,"Countries' readiness for health emergencies varies significantly, with the IHR States Parties Self-Assessment Annual Report (SPAR) tool highlighting key strengths and challenges. Globally, the top strengths include laboratory (C.4), surveillance (C.5), health emergency management (C.7), and health services provision (C.8), while challenges remain in policy, legal and normative instruments (C.1), chemical events (C.14), radiation emergencies (C.15), and human resources (C.6) (Context [1]). The European Region scores highest in capacities related to zoonotic diseases, food safety, chemical events, and radiation emergencies, whereas the African Region generally scores lowest, except for zoonotic diseases (Context [1], Figure 2.14).",2.14
13,5,1,"Countries' spending on health varies significantly by income group. As shown in Figure 2.16, high-income countries allocate the largest proportion of their government budgets to health, while low-income countries spend the least. This disparity highlights the challenges faced by lower-income nations in prioritizing health within their budgets, often relying more on external aid to meet health financing needs.",2.16
14,5,2,"Yes, many people are facing financial hardship due to health costs. The global proportion of the population experiencing catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending at the 10% threshold increased from 9.6% in 2000 to 13.5% in 2019, affecting over 1 billion people. The highest shares of such spending were reported in the Western Pacific Region (19.8%) and South-East Asia Region (16.1%), as shown in Figure 2.17.",2.17
